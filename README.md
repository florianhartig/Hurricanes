Hurricanes
==========
This contains R code (including markdown) to re-analyse the hurricanes data in Jung et al (2014) Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes PNAS, doi:10.1073/pnas.1402786111 

I (Florian Hartig) forked this repository from the previous reanalysis of Bob O'Hara. His files are still present as Hurricanes.X My files are labeled as HurricanesFH.X

To see the summary of my analysis, go to https://github.com/florianhartig/Hurricanes/blob/master/HurricanesFH.md

Further comments from me at http://theoreticalecology.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/female-hurricanes-reloaded-another-reanalysis-of-jung-et-al/

For Bob's comments and summary, see his version of the repository at https://github.com/oharar/Hurricanes as well as the blog post at http://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2014/jun/04/hurricane-gender-name-bias-sexism-statistics
