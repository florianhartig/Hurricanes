Hurricanes
==========
This contains R code (including markdown) to re-analyse the hurricanes data in Jung et al (2014) Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes PNAS, doi:10.1073/pnas.1402786111 

I forked this repository from the previous reanalysis of Bob O'Hara. His files are still present as Hurricanes.X

My files are labeled as HurricanesFH.X
